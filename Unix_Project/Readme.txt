1. copy_file.sh:

This script copies a file from a specified location to a designated folder on your server.

Explanation:

The script checks if a file path is provided as an argument.
It defines the source and destination paths (modify /path/to/destination/folder with your actual folder location).
The script verifies if the source file exists.
It copies the file with a progress indicator using cp -p.
Upon successful copy, a confirmation message is displayed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

2. download_changing_file.sh (Choose either A or B):

This script downloads a file from a URL that changes periodically. It includes two options:

A. Using wget:

This option utilizes wget to download the file.
It defines the URL of the file and the destination folder (modify /path/to/destination/folder with your actual folder location).
The script downloads the file with a timestamp appended to the filename for version control.
It retrieves the last modified time of the downloaded file for comparison in subsequent runs.
B. Using curl:

This option utilizes curl to download the file.
Similar to wget, replace wget with curl in the script.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both options require further development:

The script currently downloads the file every time it runs.
You'll need to implement logic to check the remote file's last modified time and compare it with the local copy's time (using the saved last_modified variable).
If the times differ, the script should download the new version.
Consider using cron to run this script periodically.
3. (Optional) Social Media Bot (Not Included):

This section outlines the steps for creating a bot for Twitter or GitHub, but the script itself is not included.

Choose your platform (Twitter or GitHub).
Register your application and obtain API credentials.
Develop a script in your preferred language (Python, Node.js, etc.) to interact with the chosen platform's API.
The script should check for updates, events, or new content based on the API's functionalities.
Upon detecting a change, the script can perform actions like posting a tweet (Twitter) or creating an issue/pull request (GitHub).

Important Note:

Creating bots that interact with social media platforms often have terms of service restrictions. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the platform's guidelines before deploying your bot.
